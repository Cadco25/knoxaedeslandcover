This is the compiled dataset that includes all processed landcover, climate, and mosquito collection data. This file is used to produce all analyses in the manuscript. Raw data useds to compile this file are also included; see 'analysis/(1)dataprep.R' for data processessing code. The RDS file is used in code because it maintains the numeric and factor structure of columns in R.

Codebook for data file 'NLCD_2019_landcover_clippedtoKnox.tif' 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a .tif file that contains the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) 2019 Land Cover Categories, clipped to Knox County, Tennessee, USA. The continuous values corresponding to each grid in the raster are associated with the land cover categories defined by the NLCD. This data must be analyzed in a GIS like ArcGIS or QGIS, or using spatial packages in R (see 'analysis/(1)dataprep.R' for the processing of this data in R)

Column Names:
	This data is not tabular so there are no column names. See 'https://www.mrlc.gov/data/legends/national-land-cover-database-class-legend-and-description' for description of land cover categories.
